BloodStats
==========

Is a bukkit plugin for Minecraft that enables you to track how many players you have on your server at any given time and store that data in a mysql databse.

The speciality of this plugin is that you can run it on multi-servers as well. This allows you to get a overview over all your servers and not just one.
